# fem-todo-app

This is the repo for the Front End Mentor To Do App Challenge for Week 5, Level 3 assignment with CodeX.

## Project Structure

## Project Status

This project is currently in progress.

It is being updated from a Supabase + React task list into a styled Todo application based on the Frontend Mentor Todo App challenge.

### Current Progress

* Converted the project from Bootstrap-based styling to **Tailwind CSS**
* Installed and configured **shadcn UI**
* Added reusable UI components (Button, Checkbox, Input)
* Introduced path aliases using `jsconfig.json` and Vite config
* Updated Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies to support UI interactions
* Cleaned up legacy Bootstrap dependencies and loaders
* Updated lint scripts to support JSX and Tailwind-generated CSS

Some Stylelint warnings remain related to Tailwind/shadcn-specific at-rules, which do not affect application functionality and will be addressed later.

## **Tech Stack**

- React (Vite)
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn UI
